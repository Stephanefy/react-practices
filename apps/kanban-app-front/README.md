# Kanban Board Application

A work-in-progress Kanban board application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This is a learning project focused on building a functional task management system with modern React patterns.

## Current Status

⚠️ **This project is actively being developed.** Some features may be incomplete, buggy, or subject to change.

### What's Working
- Basic board and column structure with sample data
- Task display with subtasks
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Responsive layout
- Sidebar navigation
- Modal system for various operations

### In Progress/Planned
- Drag & drop functionality (partially implemented)
- Task CRUD operations (basic create/edit in progress)
- Board management features
- Better mobile experience
- Search and filtering capabilities

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Board Display**: View multiple boards with column-based layout
- **Task Management**: Basic task display with subtask tracking
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light and dark themes
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### User Interface
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Collapsible sidebar for board switching
- **Modal System**: Portal-based modals for task and board operations
- **Mobile Menu**: Basic mobile navigation (in progress)
- **Clean Design**: Tailwind CSS based design system

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18.2.0 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development

   ```bash
   cd apps/kanban-app-front
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to view the application

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Create production build
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

## Usage

### Current Functionality
- **View Boards**: Switch between different boards using the sidebar
- **View Tasks**: Click on tasks to see details and subtasks
- **Toggle Theme**: Switch between light and dark themes
- **Responsive View**: Works on different screen sizes

### What's Being Developed
- Task creation and editing
- Board management
- Drag and drop functionality
- Search and filtering

## Data Structure

The application uses a hierarchical data structure:

```typescript
{
  boards: [
    {
      name: string,
      columns: [
        {
          name: string,
          tasks: [
            {
              title: string,
              description: string,
              status: string,
              subtasks: [
                {
                  title: string,
                  isCompleted: boolean
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Architecture

### State Management
- **Context API**: Global state management using React Context
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic extracted into custom hooks

### Component Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI components and business logic
- **Portal Pattern**: Modal components rendered outside the DOM hierarchy

### Styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
- **Dark Mode**: CSS custom properties for theme switching

## Browser Support

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
